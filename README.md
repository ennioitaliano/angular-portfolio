# Angular Portfolio - ⚠️WIP⚠️
This is just a copy of [HTML Portfolio](https://github.com/ennioitaliano/html-portfolio) but it's written using Angular.

You can see the final result at [ennioitaliano.github.io](https://ennioitaliano.github.io) and the old (but visually identical) HTML+CSS version at [ennioitaliano.github.io/html-portfolio](https://ennioitaliano.github.io/html-portfolio).

## TO-DO
- [x] Desktop/responsive CSS
- [x] Change size to social icons in footer
- [x] Update projects
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Dark mode
  - [x] Re-implement the old one
  - [x] Change memoji accordingly
  - [ ] Make it change based on user theme
